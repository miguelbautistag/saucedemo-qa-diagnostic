## 📌 Project Overview
This project consists of a deep-dive functional analysis of the [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) e-commerce platform. The goal was to identify critical functional gaps using the **'error_user'** profile and document them following industry standards.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Jira:** Defect management and bug lifecycle tracking.
- **Google Sheets:** Test case design and execution.
- **Chrome DevTools:** Console error analysis and network inspection.

## 📊 Jira Lifecycle Management
I managed the identified bugs through a standard Kanban workflow in Jira.
